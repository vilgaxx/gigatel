            Children are an integral part of our online community. The Internet
            offers kids many opportunities for learning, constructive
            entertainment, and personal growth. But there are a lot of risks
            that children face online. Working together, we can make the online
            environment a safe and rewarding experience for children. Filtering
            software like CYBERPATROL, NETNANNY, SURFWATCH, etc., can help keep
            children from inappropriate online areas. Like the rest of the
            world, the Internet may contain some material that is inappropriate
            for young audiences. There are a number of ways you can control what
            your child can see and do online. Filtering tools are a great way to
            tailor your child's online experience, but there is no substitute
            for parental involvement online. This message is being displayed to
            you as per the regulation from the Ministry of Communication &

          <h4>Information Collection and General Use</h4>

            The Company collects personal information when you register with the
            Company, when you use the Company products or services, and when you
            visit the Company pages or the pages of certain partners of the
            Company. The Company may combine information about you that we have
            with information we obtain from business partners or other
            companies. The Company shall have the right to pass on the same to
            its business associates and franchisees without referring the same
            to you. When you register, we ask for information such as your name,

            Sharing and Disclosure We provide the information to trusted
            partners who work on behalf of or with the Company under
            confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal
            information to help the Company communicate with you about offers
            from the Company and our marketing partners.
            <br />
            We believe it is necessary to share information in order to
            investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
            suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
            physical safety of any person, violations of the Company's terms of
            use, or as otherwise required by law.
            <br />
            We transfer information about you if the Company is acquired by or
            merged with another company under a different management. In this
            event, the Company will notify you before information about you is
            transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. The
            Company plans to display targeted advertisements based on personal
            information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume
            that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet
            the targeting criteria, for example, women ages 18-24 from a
            particular geographic area.
            <br />
            The Company will not provide any personal information to the
            advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by
            interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the
            possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you
            meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. The Company
            works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and service providers in
            many different industries and categories of business. We reserve the
            right to send you certain communications relating to the Company's
            service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, and
            the Company's newsletter, that are considered part of your account,
            without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
